üìä COVID-19 Excel Data Dashboard Project
----------------------------------------
‚úÖ Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data dashboard built in Microsoft Excel to visualize and analyze COVID-19 statistics across different states and zones in India. It helps users understand infection trends, death ratios, regional impacts, and overall case distribution with interactive visuals.

üß± Key Components
------------------
1. Dashboard Title & Metrics - Main Heading: ‚ÄúCOVID-19: DATA‚Äù
Summary Metrics (Top Boxes):Total Deaths,
Total Active Cases,
Total Confirmed Cases,
These values are prominently displayed in highlighted boxes for quick insights.

3. Interactive Slicers - Filters available for:
Zone: East, West, North, South.
State/UTs: Multiple Indian regions.
Slicers allow you to interactively filter charts and data views across the dashboard.

3. Pivot Charts & Visualizations
Pie Chart: Shows the percentage distribution of total cases by Zone.
Bar Chart 1: Compares Sum of Active Cases vs Deaths per zone.
Bar Chart 2: Compares Discharged Patients vs Population across states.
Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays state-wise total confirmed cases with values labeled.

4. Pivot Tables (Behind the Scenes)
Used to summarize data and feed into visual charts.
Metrics like Total, Discharged, Population, Active, and Deaths are calculated using pivot logic.

5. Data Metrics Calculated
Total confirmed = Active + Discharged + Deaths,
Death Ratio (Implied): Deaths / Confirmed,
Recovery Comparison: Discharged vs Population.
